A simple proof of concept species distribution model was fitted using MaxEng with 19 bioclimate variables from worldclim v2.
Default parameters were used for presence-only model.

Locations of A thaliana presence were retrieved from GBIF

The pre-fitted model is in mod.rda

The pre-computed prediction under present conditions is sdm.rda
The pre-computed prediction under 2050 climate model under MPI CMIP5 SPP7 rcp8.5 is sdmfut.rda
